RESTify

    RESTify IS CURRENTLY IN DEVELOPMENT NO OFFICAL RELEASE EXISTS
    PLEASE CONSIDER WHAT YOU FIND IN THE TRUNK AS PRE-RELEASE APLHA MATERIAL
    I AM TO ONLY COMMIT WORKING BUILDS BUT THIS IS NOT ALWAYS THE CASE...

    RESTify is a REST based Spotify client that runs on Windows

         -  You'll need a Spotify account and you'll have to log in to be able to use RESTify
            (it's against the libspotify "Terms of Use" to expose Spotify to non-Spotify users)

         -  It plays music, but only on the local computer running RESTify (no streaming)

    Enough with the legal mumbo jumbo...

         -  It's a remotly controllable Spotify client than can used in a common space
            and anyone with a Spotify account can fiddle with it

             *  Everyone with a Spotify account can queue up songs
             
             *  Everyone with a Spotify account is given an equal amount of "air time"
             
             *  RESTify maintains a local database with statistics over what songs you like the most
                you can use this to build new playlists

The RESTify only runs on Windows but the web based UI is accessible by any computer on the local subnet
